# Hearing_Evaluation

## Background
This evaluation was created to test your ear's ability to hear a range of frequencies. Your ear responds differently at certain frequencies than others, which is called a frequency response. Our ears have a distinct frequency response that changes as we age. This test is designed to determine your own ear's frequency response.

This test plays 250Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 4000Hz, and 8000Hz signals. Each frequency will start at an audible amplitude, then slowly lower the amplitude until you can hear it no loger. Then it will proceed to the next frequency, until all of the frequencies are tested. Once finished, you can plot your ear's freqency response on a graph to visualize it.

## Running the test

In order to run the test, open the 'HearingTest.m' Matlab script file. Once loaded, click 'Run', then click the 'Start Test' button on the GUI that pops up.

Now, either click 'Yes' to indicate that you heard the tone or 'No' to indicate that you did not hear it. Make sure to wait until the sound is finished to click a button.

The process will continue until the test has checked every frequency. Once the top right text says 'Status of Test: Finished', then you can click 'Plot' to see your ear's frequency response.
